        Maintaining a balanced diet rich in whole foods, combined with regular exercise, is key to long-term health. Prioritize lean proteins, healthy fats, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Stay hydrated and ensure adequate sleep for recovery. Consistency is more important than perfection

        That’s awesome! Building muscle while staying lean can definitely be done with the right approach. Keep focusing on compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and bench press for overall strength. For staying lean, make sure you’re eating in a slight caloric surplus with plenty of protein to fuel muscle growth without adding too much fat. And don’t forget to prioritize rest days for recovery—your muscles grow when you rest, not just in the gym
